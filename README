MidiRecorder is a MUI frontend and backend for use with Euterpea,
the DSL for music in Haskell.

There are two main components to MidiRecorder:
(1) A MUI frontend, which allows for recording
(2) A backend, which quantizes and transforms the recorded input into Euterpea MUSIC values.


This stuff is also in RecMUI.lhs!! This is only a README and contains
a copy of the project report.
